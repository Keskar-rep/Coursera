# Working with Test Patterns

## Question 1: Applying Spatial Filters

**Which of the following images is the result of applying a 3x3 averaging filter to the checkerboard test image (see above)?**

**Solution**:  
*Option: (Black&White checkerboard blur with the lesser trippy illusion)*

---

## Question 2: Applying Spatial Filters

**Which of the following images is the result of applying Canny edge detection to the checkerboard test image (see above)?**

**Solution**:  
*Option: (Image having boxes between checkerboard squares with white horizontal and vertical lines running across)*

---

## Question 3: Visualizing Gradients

**Consider using edge detection for handwriting analysis of the following image: Which of the following represents the vertical gradient of the image's edge detection?**  
**Note**: This image was first filtered with imgaussfilt.

**Solution**:  
*Option: (The one with prominent horizontal edge)*

## Question 4: Detecting Edges

**Detect edges using the filtered coins1.jpg image described above. Which of these images shows the edges detected using the Canny method?**

**Solution**:  
*Option: (Image having medium noise)*

## Questions 5 and 6: Counting Coins

### Question 5

**Use the imfindcircles function to find only the four largest coins. What value can be used as the lower value of the radius range to eliminate the smaller coins?**

**Solution**:  
*No Solution Found*

### Question 6

**Which of the following is the result of using imfindcircles and viscircles to count the number of coins with radius less than 65. How many are there?**

**Solution**:  
*8*
